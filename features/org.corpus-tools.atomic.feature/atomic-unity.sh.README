What is 'atomic-unity.sh'?
==========================

'atomic-unity.sh' is a custom launcher script for Unity desktops [1]. 
If you use Unity, use this script to start Atomic.

Why a custom launcher just for Unity?
-------------------------------------

Unity has a feature called the Global Menu: Instead of placing application menus inside the application window, 
Unity places them in the top bar of the desktop window.

Unfortunately, Eclipse (and thus Eclipse-based applications such as Atomic) do not fully support the
Global Menu. This results in a number of issues when using Eclipse or Eclipse-based applications under
Unity, e.g., some menus will not appear in full. In the case of Atomic, the main side-effect of using the
Global Menu is that the key combination for keyboard shortcuts is not displayed next to the respective menu item.

Solution: 'atomic-unity.sh'
---------------------------

Thankfully, there is an environment variable addressing the Global Menu in Ubuntu: 'UBUNTU_MENUPROXY'. If set to '0',
the Global Menu isn't used. Instead, the application menus will be placed in the actual application window.

The launcher script 'atomic-unity.sh' does just that. It simply calls 'UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0' and then continues
to start Atomic via the default launcher 'atomic'. The script also accepts any arguments you may want to pass
in to the application. E.g., './atomic-unity.sh -consoleLog'.

How to use 'atomic-unity.sh'
-----------------------------

Simply navigate into the Atomic installation folder, and call the script. On the command line, you can pass in arguments as well:
$> ./atomic-unity.sh -consoleLog
OR
$> bash atomic-unity.sh -consoleLog
